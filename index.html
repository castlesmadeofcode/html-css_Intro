                    Meet the Park Family, the picture of aspirational wealth. And the Kim Family, rich in street smarts
                    but
                    not much else. Be it chance or fate, these two houses are brought together, and the Kims sense a
                    golden
                    opportunity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Masterminded by college-aged Ki-woo, the two Kim children expediently install themselves as tutor
                    and
                    art therapist to the Parks. Soon, a symbiotic relationship forms between the two families. The Kims
                    provide “indispensable” luxury services while the Parks obliviously bankroll their entire household.
                    When a parasitic interloper threatens the Kims’ newfound comfort, a savage underhanded battle for
                    dominance breaks out, threatening the fragile ecosystem between the Kims and the Parks. By turns
                    darkly
                    hilarious and heart-wrenching, PARASITE showcases a modern master at the top of his game. Winner of
                    the
                    Palme d’Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival.
